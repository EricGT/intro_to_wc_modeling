Quickly analyzing large simulation results
=====================================================
As described above, currently there are only a few primitive database for organizing simulation results. In addition to develop better simulation results databases, we must develop better tools for search, extracting, and reducing data stored in such databases. We recommend that such tools be developed using distributed computing frameworks such as `Spark <https://spark.apache.org/>`_.
