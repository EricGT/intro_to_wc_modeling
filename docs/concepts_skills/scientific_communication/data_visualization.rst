Visualizing data
================

* Leverage the human visual system's abilities to process visual information
* Use easily understandable data encodings

    * Utilize position and length
    * Use a small number of easily discriminable colors
    * Avoid 3D and animation

* Display data in its context

    * Use appropriate scales
    * Compare
    * Lay data out on familiar maps such as geographical and pathway maps

* Use small multiples to visualize additional dimensions
* Avoid red/green color palettes to accommodate colorblindness
* Avoid distracting viewers with unnecessary data and other unnecessary visual marks


Interactive exploratory data visualization
------------------------------------------
Static visualizations are helpful to depicting data. However, static visualizations are generally limited to a few dimensions. Consequently, static visualizations can generally only depict small fraction of large data sets. Alternatively, interactive data visualizations can enable exploration of larger and higher dimensional datasets. See `d3js.org <d3js.org>`_ for inspiring examples of interactive data visualizations, The major disadvantages of interactive data visualization are that are more complex and take more time to create.


Software tools
--------------
Below are several recommend tools for creating data visualizations:

* Exploring data

    * Tableau

* Creating specific plots

    * Python and matplotlib: useful for plotting data

* Combining plots into figures

    * Illustrator
    * Inkscape

* Creating interactive data visualizations

    * JavaScript and D3.js
    * ipyvega


Exercises
---------

* Use matplotlib to create a static visualization
* Use illustrator to combine multiple static visualizations
* Use ipyvega to create an interactive visualization
