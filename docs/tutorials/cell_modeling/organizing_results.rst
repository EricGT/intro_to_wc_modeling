Organizing simulation results
=====================================================
To facilitate analysis of large simulation result sets including identifying relevant simulations to analyze, retrieving slices of simulation results, and calculating statistics about simulation results, it is helpful to organize simulation results into a database. Such databases should store simulation results, as well as all of the metadata needed to understand and reproduce the simulation results.

Currently, there are only a few primitive database for simulation results including

* `Bookshelf <http://sbcb.bioch.ox.ac.uk/bookshelf>`_
* `Dynameomics <http://www.dynameomics.org>`_
* `SEEK <https://fair-dom.org/platform/seek>`_
* `WholeCellSimDB <http://www.wholecellsimdb.org>`_
