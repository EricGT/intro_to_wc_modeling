Writing code for Python 2 and 3
===============================
Because Python 2.7 and 3 are similar, and because many people still use Python 2, we recommend writing code that is compatible with both Python 2.7 and 3. Furthermore, we recommend using the ``future`` and ``six`` to write code that is compatible with both Python 2.7 and 3. `http://python-future.org <http://python-future.org>`_ provides helpful summaries of the differences between Python 2.7 and 3, and how to write code that is compatible with both Python 2.7 and 3.
