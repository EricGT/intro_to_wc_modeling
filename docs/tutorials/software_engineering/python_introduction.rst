An introduction to Python
=========================
The goal of this tutorial is to introduce the fundamentals of Python to scientists who are already familiar with at least one other object-oriented programming language such as Java, MATLAB, or Perl.


Installing Python and Python development tools
----------------------------------------------
To get started using Python, we recommend installing Python 3, the `pip package manager <https://pip.pypa.io>`_, the `Sublime text editor <https://www.sublimetext.com/>`_, and the `ipython interactive shell <https://ipython.org>`_. See our :ref:`installation instructions <software_development_tools_installation>` for more information.
