Funding streams for your lab
----------------------------
* NIH: National Institutes of Health

    * Single investigator programs (e.g. R01, R21)
    * Research program awards (e.g. R35)
    * High-risk / high-reward awards (DP1-7)
    * Center grants (P, U)

* Your institution
    
    * Many institutions have programs for small seed grants
    * Often these are designed to encourage collaborations across departments and/or institutions    

* Institutional training grants for graduate students and postdoctoral scholars

    * Very simple applications
    * Don't consume PI percent effort

* Graduate, postdoctoral fellowships

    * Relatively easy to win
    * Don't consume PI percent effort

* Industry contracts


Funding programs for early career investigators
-----------------------------------------------
Below is a list of some of the biggest funding opportunities specifically for early career investigators

* NIGMS Maximizing Investigators' Research Award (MIRA, R35)

    * Funds research programs
    * $250,000 per year
    * 51% effort required
    * 6 page application that emphasizes the applicant, the major challenges in their field, and their proposed research program

* Director's Program New Innovator Award (DP2)

    * Funds high-risk, high-reward research
    * No preliminary data required
    * $300,000 per year
    * 25% effort required
    * 12 page application that emphasizes the applicant, significance, and innovation

* NSF Faculty Early Career Development Program
* DOE Early Career Research Program
* DOD Young Faculty Award
* Non-profit foundations

    * Beckman Young Investigators Program
    * Pew Scholars 
    * Searle Scholars Program
    * Sloan Research Fellowships

See `http://www.spo.berkeley.edu/fund/newfaculty.html <http://www.spo.berkeley.edu/fund/newfaculty.html>`_ for a list of additional smaller funding opportunities for new faculty.

In addition, many NIH institutes have lower funding thresholds for `New Investigators` (NI; applicants which have not yet received an R01 or equivalent) and `Early Stage Invesigators` (ESI; applicants within 10 years of the completion of their PhD or medical residency). Keep in mind that winning a grant as a Co-PI, would also terminate your NI status. For this reason, until you receive your first grant as the primary PI, it could be a good strategy not to submit proposals as a Co-PI and instead submit those proposals as a Co-Investigator.

Proposal structure
------------------


Budgeting
---------


Submitting proposals
--------------------
Proposals must be submitted through your institutions Grants and Contracts Office using their online proposal submission system. These online systems are straightforward. They simply require you to upload each component of your proposal as a .docx or .pdf document and enter your budget using a set of webforms. Typically, proposals must be submitted internally 1-2 weeks in advance of the external deadline. 


Advice for winning grants
-------------------------
* Focus on significant problems and propose innovative solutions
* Generate compelling proof-of-concept
* Publicize your proof-of-concept
* Identify topical funding mechanisms
* Thoroughly read the funding opportunity announcement
* Discuss your ideas with the program officers, especially for DARPA, DOD, and DOE
* Solicit examples of proposals that have been funded by the same program and solicit advice from previous winners. This is particularly helpful for the administrative sections of proposals.
* Dedicate significant grant writing time and allow extra time for unfamiliar opportunities
* Determine who your audience is and write for them
* Follow all of the directions in funding opportunity announcements
* Seek feedback for your colleagues and your lab


Resubmissions
-------------
Below is our advice for submitting revised proposals

* Carefully read all of the reviewers concerns
* Keep in mind that blaming the reviewers is not productive. You can't change the reviewers or program officers, but you can change your proposal and how you present it.
* Keep in mind that reviewer concerns are often rooted in poor explanations rather than bad ideas. For this reason, reviewer concerns can often be addressed simply by clarifying the proposal.
* Synthesize and rank the reviewers' concerns
* Develop a revised plan that addresses all of the reviewers' concerns. 
* Discuss your plans with the program officers
* Revise your proposal. This could require re-writing your entire proposal.

In addition to all of the content of the first submission, NIH resubmissions must include a 1-page "Introduction to resubmission". These documents should (a) summarize the reviewer's major concerns, (b) summarize your major revisions, and (c) provide a point-by-point summary of each of the reviewers' major concerns and describe how you have addressed them or why you believe they are unfounded.

To help reviewers identify the major changes to your proposal, you should mark these sections with vertical bars in the margins.
